### 1) Description of the problem and a discussion of the background.

Toronto, the most populous city in Canada, with a population of 2,731,571 as of 2016. Current to 2016, the Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA), of which the majority is within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), held a population of 5,928,040, making it Canada's most populous CMA.The Toronto metropolitan area was the second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in North America, adding 125,298 persons.

The Toronto region’s Food and Beverage sector employs more than 64,000 workers with annual wages totaling $3.2B. Sector businesses located within the city of Toronto account for more than 50 per cent of this workforce.

The amount of tea that Canadians drink has doubled in the past few decades. As of 2015, Canadians drink 85 litres per person per year, up from 79.4 litres in 2008, and only 36 litres in 1991! Tea surpassed both soft drinks and bottled water, and is only slightly less than the amount of coffee that Canadians drink. However it’s also interesting to note that the average amount of coffee drank by Canadians decreased from the previous year, while tea rose by several litres.
